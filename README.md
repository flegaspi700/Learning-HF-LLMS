# Learning Hugging Face LLMs

My personal learning journey to understand and work with Large Language Models using the Hugging Face ecosystem. This repository contains my experiments, notes, and practice code as I learn how to use and fine-tune LLMs.

## What's Here

- **Text Generation Examples** - Testing models like Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct
- **Fine-Tuning Experiments** - Learning to adapt models for specific tasks
- **Framework Comparisons** - Notes on SFTTrainer, Unsloth, Axolotl, and TorchTune
- **Practical Troubleshooting** - Solutions to common issues I've encountered

This is a learning repository focused on hands-on experimentation with transformers, tokenization, model training, and the broader Hugging Face toolkit.
